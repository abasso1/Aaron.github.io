    <p> Below is a map of all the states the owner of AB Prouctions has hunted in! Shown on the map are all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington DC. The light blue colored states represent places the owner has never hunted in while the yellow colored states represent states that the owner has! The Mallard duck centered over Stuttgart Arkansas is there to mark the duck hunting capitol of the world. Quite often has the owner traveled here to experince some of the world class hunting that is offered here! The large red line represents the Mason-Dixion line. This line extends to seperate the North and the South (we wont go into which is the better half of the country)</p>
